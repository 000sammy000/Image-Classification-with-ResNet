# Introduction
In this assignment, the task is to classify images of various animals and plants. Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved great success in this field.  

ResNet is a widely used architecture for image classification due to its ability to handle vanishing gradients with residual connections. In this work, I employ SE-ResNet, an enhanced version of ResNet that incorporates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks. These blocks adaptively reweight feature channels to help the model focus on more important features, improving feature representation and overall accuracy.
By utilizing SE-ResNet, I aim to enhance classification performance while keeping computational cost reasonable.
